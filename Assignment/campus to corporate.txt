CAMPUS TO CORPORATE

1.What is called corporate culture?
Corporate culture is like the personality of a company. It shapes how everyone works together and interacts, influencing how happy and productive people are at work.

2.How corporate culture is different from campus culture?
Campus culture is like a laid-back environment where learning and personal growth are the main focus. Corporate culture, on the other hand, is more formal and structured, aiming to achieve business goals. Moving from one to the other means adjusting to different expectations and ways of working.
